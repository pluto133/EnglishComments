Hilarious, but understood how much hate Five Giys gets here. It's damn sure expensive, but it's not nearly as bad as the haters claim it to be. They're a lot better than most of the chains that get praise in this sub, but the price for me is what kills them.

Although, you can't beat a huge bag full of fies for $8 if you feel the need to order a large. I grilled some burgers on the 4th for myself and three others and grabbed a large due to forgetting some fries for the air fryer. Worked like a charm. Damn good and cheaper than two large orders from the local nationwide fast food joints, which would have only fed two.
